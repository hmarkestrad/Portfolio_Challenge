    <section id="about"><br>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been working in the medical design and manufacturing industry for more than 25 years. I have more than half-dozen patents. I have negotiated and have experience in product and intellectual property licensing and sales.<br><br>

        I believe I possess an artistic eye for the aesthetics of design, the beauty of form, and the need for impeccable functionality. While a medical corpsman in the United States Navy, Mark served as a surgical technician and it is through his training he began to cultivate a vision for innovative design in the medical industry. Working in all aspects  of the operating room, Mark began to conceive of new and better ways for surgeons to achieve better clinical outcomes for their patients. <br><br>
        
        Recruited by Johnson & Johnson, Mark combined his military discipline with his passion for the industry to become J & J’s top sales representative. His stellar reputation and achievements prompted J & J to move Mark in-house to bring his design concepts into reality. While there, he learned how to move from concept to design, to prototype, to manufacturing and distribution.<br><br>
        
        Since his time at J & J, Mark has brought several new products to market on behalf of other companies, as well as for ventures in which he was an owner/partner. He has successfully launched several other companies, including insight Dental Systems and e-crutch.<br><br>
        
        Today, Mark’s vast knowledge base in functional, anatomical aesthetics and his passion for medical technology compel him to innovate.</p>

      <h2>Resume</h2>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
